# Fullstack Laboration 3

LÃ¤nk till deployment: [Deployment](https://fullstack-laboration-3.vercel.app/)

## Introduction

For the third lab in my fullstack development course i wanted to focus on a couple of key areas.

-   First of all, i wanted to revisit NextJS and explore the oppurtunities that NextJS 15.0 offered.
-   I also wanted to try my hands at as well of a login/auth system as I could make at this time. Security and user experience are the main
    areas of auth I wanted to focus on, where a solid mechanism could keep the user signed in until they choose to logout.
-   Third, I wanted to make something that would have real life benefits, and the idea of the usecase for this app is a student portal
    for my old workplace.

## Requirements

In the course we have varius limitations that dictate how the app could be built. Main problems with my choise of techstack is that
the backend had to be written in express and using a postgre database. And for extra credits in the course the app had to be deployed
on the web. Something that atfirst didn't worry me, but became a huge headache down the line.
